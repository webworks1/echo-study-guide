# Pathology Correlation — Case Walkthroughs

## Case 1 — Pulmonary Hypertension Probability
- TRV = 3.3 m/s  
- TAPSE = 1.3 cm, FAC = 28%  
- RA area enlarged, IVC dilated ↓ collapse  

**Interpretation (ASE 2025):** TRV 3.3 → moderate band + supportive signs = elevated PH probability.  
**Report:** “PH probability intermediate–high per ASE 2025 Right-Heart guideline.”

## Case 2 — Diastolic Dysfunction (HFpEF phenotype)
- E/A = 2.2   E/e′ = 16   LAVI = 38   TRV = 2.9 m/s  
→ Elevated LV filling pressure by ASE 2025 algorithm.

---

## Case 3 — RV Dysfunction Staging
- TAPSE = 1.05 cm   FAC = 23%   S′ = 6.0 cm/s  
→ Moderate–severe RV systolic dysfunction (per graded bands ASE 2025).
