# Intermediate Guide — Overview

Level focus: **application & interpretation**.  
Builds on Beginner by adding advanced Doppler logic, right-heart evaluation, and case-based reasoning.

## What you’ll learn
- Integrate **TR velocity (TRV)** + supportive signs to grade **PH probability**.  
- Apply updated **diastolic** criteria (ASE 2025 update).  
- Work through **case correlations** (HCM / DCM / Restrictive / Pericardial disease).

> All numeric cutoffs sourced from **ASE Right-Heart in Adults 2025** and **ASE LV Diastolic Function 2025** guidelines.
