# Cardiac Pathologies
*(ASE & IAC-Verified 2024–2025)*

## Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH)
| Type | IVS (cm) | PW (cm) | LV Mass Index (g/m²) | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------------------|--------|
| Normal | ≤1.0 | ≤1.0 | ≤115 (M), ≤95 (F) | Normal geometry |
| Concentric | >1.0 | >1.0 | Elevated | Often due to HTN |
| Eccentric | >1.0 | Normal | Elevated | Often due to volume overload |

---

## Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)
- LVEDD > 5.8 cm (men), > 5.2 cm (women)  
- LVEF < 40%  
- Global hypokinesis  
- MR and TR secondary to dilation  

**Key Doppler:** Reduced dP/dt, low stroke volume.

---

## Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
- Asymmetric septal hypertrophy (>1.3:1 ratio)  
- LVOT gradient ≥ 30 mmHg at rest or ≥ 50 mmHg with provocation  
- SAM of mitral valve and MR jet posteriorly directed  

**Key Doppler:** High LVOT velocity (>4.0 m/s).

---

## Restrictive Cardiomyopathy
- Bi-atrial enlargement  
- E/A > 2.0, E/e′ > 15  
- Normal LV size, thickened walls  
- Reduced tissue Doppler velocities

## Pericardial Effusion / Tamponade
| Finding | Mild | Moderate | Severe |
|----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Size (mm) | <10 | 10–20 | >20 |
| RA collapse | None | Early diastole | Throughout |
| RV collapse | None | Early diastole | Throughout |
| IVC size | <2.1 | 2.1–2.5 | >2.5, poor collapse |
