A. Cardiac Anatomy & Chamber/Valve Nomenclature

Chambers: Left Ventricle (LV), Left Atrium (LA), Right Ventricle (RV), Right Atrium (RA).
– RV = crescent-shaped; LV = ellipsoid; LA = ovoid.

Coronary Arteries:
– LAD → anterior septum and apex.
– LCx → lateral and posterior walls.
– RCA → RV and posteromedial papillary muscle.

Valves:
– Aortic: 3 cusps (RCC, LCC, NCC)
– Mitral: anterior/posterior leaflets
– Tricuspid: 3 leaflets
– Pulmonic: 3 cusps

Normal Dimensions (ASE 2025 cut-offs):
– LV end-diastole (LVIDd): 3.9 – 5.3 cm
– Aortic root: < 3.7 cm
– LA volume index (LAVI): < 34 mL/m²

B. Standard Imaging Windows and Views

Parasternal Long Axis (PLAX):
– Displays LV length, IVS, posterior wall, mitral and aortic valves.
– Measurements: Aortic valve cusp separation, LVOT diameter, M-mode wall thickness/dimensions.

Parasternal Short Axis (PSAX):
– Shows LV cross-section at aortic, mitral, papillary, and apical levels.
– LV should appear circular; segments map to coronary territories.

Apical Views (A4C, A2C, A3C, A5C):
– Used for volume and Doppler assessment (e.g., biplane EF).
– RV ≈ ⅔ LV size in A4C.

Subcostal & Suprasternal Notch (SSN):
– Visualize IVC, abdominal aorta, and aortic arch.
– IVC Collapse Index used for RAP estimation.

C. Key Hemodynamics & Formulas

Stroke Volume (SV):
SV = LVIDd³ – LVIDs³ (Teichholz) or SV = VTI × CSA

Cardiac Output (CO):
CO = SV × HR

Continuity Equation:
A₁ × V₁ = A₂ × V₂ → used to calculate valve areas.

1.3 Mandatory Image Sourcing List
Image No.	Priority	View & Modality	Purpose & Required Finding
1	HIGH	PLAX 2D	Label LV, RVOT, LA, Ao, IVS, PW – Normal gain.
2	HIGH	PSAX (mid-papillary level)	LV perfect circle – normal segment motion.
3	HIGH	A4C 2D	Mitral vs Tricuspid valve size – RV < ⅔ LV.
4	MEDIUM	SSN CW Doppler	Aortic arch flow – laminar pattern.
5	HIGH	PLAX M-Mode	Measure IVS, LVID, LVPW – normal dimensions/FS.
